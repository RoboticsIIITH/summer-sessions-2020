## Where and When?
* Microsoft Teams.
* Timings: 3 pm - 4:30 pm (can extend by 30 mins for discussing assignments/quizzes) unless it is explicitly mentioned in the table. (Only starting time is mentioned, it is of duration 1.5 hrs as usual)
###  Bad internet connection?
* For those with bad internet connectivity, you can watch it later on [Microsoft Stream](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/3c70bd68-2579-4150-9134-839a8d8ee9a4) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi59bVTQX5Rpr4umjFfbXeWjfqBwMgLql). The videos will be available within 3 hours after the session has ended, contact the undersigned only if you aren't able to find the video in the playlist even after 3 hours.

## Assignments

### Plan for assignments/quizzes
#### Assignments
* Note: Assignments and/or quizzes are not being held for every topic, check the below tables for more details.

If an assignment is given for a particular concept, we have given a break of 1 day before next concept begins for solving this assignment. Also, the solutions to this assignment will be discussed at the end of next session, for example math review assignment will be discussed at the end of 3rd session (or sometimes at the beginning of the next session in which case the session will start early). But the discussion will be brief for about 30 minutes and you will not be able to follow if you haven't solved the assignment, so please solve it beforehand.

The presenter will confirm the assignment discussion session timings for his specific assignment at the end of his sessions.
#### Quizzes
Regarding quizzes, they will be at the end of a particular session itself to gauge how much you have learned during that session.


### Assignment Schedule
| Assignment No. | Duration for solving |       Topic      |       File Link        | Date of discussion|
|:--------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:------------------:|:-------:|
|1 | 19-20/05 | Linear Algebra & Calculus| TBD | 21/05 |
|2 & 3| TBD | Deep Learning | TBD | TBD |
|4 | TBD | ROS | TBD | TBD |
|5 | TBD | Transformations | TBD | TBD |
|6 | TBD | Projective Geometry  | TBD | TBD |
|7-8 | TBD | MVG + BA | TBD | TBD |
|9 | TBD | State Estimation | TBD | TBD |
|10| TBD | Visual Servoing | TBD | TBD |

* Note: Do not get intimidated by looking at the volume of the assignments, we have designed the schedule ensuring that you have enough time between sessions to solve each assignment.

### Quiz Schedule
(At the end of a particular session)

| Quiz No. |     Topic      |
|:--------------:|:------------:|
|1-4 | Deep Learning|
|5-6 | Transformations and Projective Geometry|
|7-8 | MVG|
