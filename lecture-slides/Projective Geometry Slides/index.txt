You don't need to study everything from these slides. Most of them have different notations and conventions so just rememeber to be careful with those.
If you're watching the Stachniss Lectures then the Extrinsics&Intricsics slides is enough. 

Relevant stuff from the other slides:
1) Transformations.pdf : 11 - 43
2) Pinhole_model.pdf : 17 - 21. You can check out the initial content for general knowledge
3) Stachniss.pdf: Only the introduction for what are intrinsics and extrinsic parameters. Use these slides if you're studying the stachniss course
